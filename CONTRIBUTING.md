# Contributor Guidelines

Welcome! We're glad you're interested in contributing to our projects.

We welcome contributions from people of all backgrounds who are interested in making great software with us.

[TODO more background]

We're also hiring full-time engineers to work with us in Stockholm! Check out our current job postings [here](https://embark.games/careers).

## Issues

### Feature Requests

If you have ideas or how to improve our projects, you can suggest features by opening a GitHub issue. Make sure to include details about the feature or change, and describe any uses cases it would enable.

Feature requests will be tagged as `enhancement` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.

### Bugs

When reporting a bug or unexpected behaviour in a project, make sure your issue descibes steps to reproduce the behaviour, including the platform you were using, what steps you took, and any error messages.

Reproducible bugs will be tagged as `bug` and their status will be updated in the comments of the issue.

### Wontfix

Issues will be closed and tagged as `wontfix` if we decide that we do not wish to implement it, usually due to being misaligned with the project vision or out of scope. We will comment on the issue with more detailed reasoning.

## Contribution Workflow

If you want to make changes or add functionality to one of our projects, you can .......

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a new feature branch.

3. Make your changes. Ensure that there are no build errors by running the project with your changes locally.

4. Open a pull request with a name and description of what you did. You can read more about working with pull requests on GitHub [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

5. A maintainer will review your pull request and may ask you to make changes.

## Code Guidelines

You can read about our standards and recommendations for working with Rust [here](development-guidelines.md).

## Licensing

Unless otherwise specified, all Embark open source projects are licensed under a dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license, allowing licensees to chose either at their option. You can read more in each project's respective README.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that our projects are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md) to ensure that they are welcoming places for everyone to contribute. By participating in any Embark open source project, you agree to abide by these terms.
