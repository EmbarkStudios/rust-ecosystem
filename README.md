# Embark Rust Ecosystem 🦀

High-level tracking and discussions about improving Rust and the Rust ecosystem for game development at [Embark](http://embark.games) and in general.

Check out the __[Issues](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/issues)__ for active topics & discussions and [`guidelines.md`](guidelines.md) for our guidelines & policies for how we develop in Rust.

## Background

TODO: Why we use Rust, what our hopes are with this. We belive this language and ecosystem is the future.

## Areas

Areas that we are working on, or interested in & want to help improve in/with Rust:

* ☸ __[Distributed systems](https://areweasyncyet.rs/)__ - [async](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/), [tokio](https://tokio.rs/), [tower-grpc](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower-grpc)

* 🕹️ __[Game engine systems](http://arewegameyet.com/)__ - multiplayer, rendering, physics, audio, server, assets, workflows

* 📦 __Developer experience__ - fast iteration with large projects/monorepos, debugging, profiling, IDE, tools

* 🍃 __[Bazel](https://bazel.build/)__ - distributed & unified multi-ecosystem build system. [#19](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/issues/19)

* 🛸 __[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [WASI](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/03/standardizing-wasi-a-webassembly-system-interface/)__ - sandboxed safe Rust code on client, edge & cloud

* 🤖 __[Machine learning](http://www.arewelearningyet.com/)__ - efficient inference, library bindings, training environments

* 🚀 __High performance runtime__ - CPU job scheduling, code generation, optimizing crates

* 📺📱 __Console & mobile platform support__ - PlayStation, Xbox, Stadia, future hw. iOS & Android. [#18](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/issues/18)

* 🏎 __Rust on GPU__ - future compute & ML programming models beyond shaders
