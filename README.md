# Embark Rust Ecosystem

[![Embark logo](media/embark-logo-bg.jpg)](http://embark.games)

High-level tracking and discussions about improving Rust and the Rust ecosystem for game development at [Embark](http://embark.games).

Check out the __[Issues](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/rust-ecosystem/issues)__ for active topics.

## Background

TODO: Why we use Rust, what our hopes are with this. We belive this language and ecosystem is the future.

## Open Source

Open source Rust projects we've created and are using/maintaining:

* 🌋 [`ash-molten`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/ash-molten.git) - Statically linked MoltenVK for Vulkan on Mac using Ash
* 👷 [`buildkite-jobify`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/buildkite-jobify) - Kubekite, but in Rust, using configuration from your repos
* ❌ [`cargo-deny`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/cargo-deny) - Tool to maintaining your entire crate graph in large repositories
* 🎳 [`physx-rs`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/physx-rs) - Use [NVIDIA PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX) in Rust
* 🔐 [`tame-oauth`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/tame-oauth) - Small OAuth crate that follows the sans-io approach

Also see the crates on [crates.io](https://crates.io/users/embark-studios).

### Contributing

We encourage contributions to any of our open source projects. If you're not sure where to start, look at the GitHub issues on any of the above projects!

Check out [`guidelines.md`](guidelines.md) for our guidelines & policies for how we develop in Rust.

To make sure we keep a friendly and safe environment for everyone, we have a Contributor Code of Conduct. You can read this in any of our projects' repositories. By contributing to our projects, you agree to the code of conduct.
